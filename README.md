This project aims to predict future events or trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. 
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem of traditional RNNs, making it particularly effective for sequence prediction tasks.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional for experimentation and visualization)


Usage:

1.Data Collection: Gather relevant data for the prediction task. This could be historical data, real-time data streams, or any other source relevant to the events or trends you want to predict.

2.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the LSTM model. This may involve steps such as normalization, scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.

3.Model Training: Build and train the LSTM model using the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters such as the number of LSTM layers, number of neurons in each layer, learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to achieve optimal performance.

4.Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or others relevant to your prediction task. Use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure the model's generalization capability.

5.Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, use it to make predictions on new data. Monitor the predictions over time and assess their accuracy and reliability.

6.Visualization: Visualize the model's predictions alongside the actual data to gain insights into the predicted trends and assess the model's performance visually.
